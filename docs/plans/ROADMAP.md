Autonomy deep dive 2026-10-06 (research 0007, operator order: self-aware,
low-input EW): 13 plans 061-073 ranked by operator inputs removed per play
session vs build cost. Priority: 061 first - the shipped profile default
calls a robots-disallowed host (floor defect); then 062 auto session and
063 auto-OCR (the two biggest per-session input sinks), 064 notice
auto-import (weekly typing), 065 zero-config paths (unblocks 062/063 on a
fresh box). 066 waits on 063 (Depends on). Every plan uses only the ToS
floor's passive signals (session log, saved screenshots + OCR, arsha GETs,
robots-allowed public pages, clock, stored data). Dedupe vs 001-060: 059
parser reused by 064; 046 prompt superseded by 062 for auto sessions; 041
auto level sample replaced by 066; 025 Home hosts 069. Rejected: input-idle
AFK detection (needs an input hook), live window capture, clipboard reads,
roster OCR, auto-tick of redeemed coupons.

Deep dive 2026-10-06 (research 0006): two plans. Ranking: 059 first - pays
off every week from today, removes the biggest manual-typing chore on the
Events tab and reuses plan 014's proven robots-gated fetcher; 060 second -
high value once the operator is Lv 60+ and the post-patch Lv 62+ per-kill
cap (~0.01 %) makes books a main XP source, but books only exist from the
2026-10-15 maintenance. Rejected: Steam news feed (api.steampowered.com
robots.txt disallows `/`), level-gap helper (plan 018 steps 5-6), per-level
stat card (sheet AP already includes it). Data items (no plan): 6-49
per-kill cap bands into `xp_epochs.json`; verify the plan 018 epoch after
the 2026-10-08 patch notes.

Deep dive + UX audit 2026-10-05 session 4 (research 0003-0005): plans 019-057,
39 plans from 21 + 25 + 15 candidates and 30 UX findings. Ordering rationale:
019 first because the loop dispatches 3 lanes with no dependency order and
later plans carry `Depends on:` lines (each dependent plan also carries a
code-presence guard until 019 lands). Then the UX correctness fix that makes
the dashboard stop lying about health (020), the Sunday-reset model that 033
and 056 build on (021), the overlay off the minimap (022), and the two
progression wins with verified data and a hard date (023 AP/DP brackets, 024
Olvia enrolment closes 2026-11-05). After the priority rows: glance surfaces
(025 Home, 026 notifications), small market wins (027-029), settings (030),
world bosses (031-032), gear-gated weekly plan and roadmap (033-034), the
enhancement chain (035-037), loot economy (038-040), profile-API trackers
(041-042), rosters (043-045), then UX polish and lower-value calculators
(046-057). Dropped as duplicates of 001-018: 0003 C20 (018 milestones),
0003 C21 (007 notes), 0003 C08 (018 presets), 0004 F22 (research 0002 s5),
0004 F23 (002 hot list). Deferred (low value, L effort or blocked source):
0003 C15 next-upgrade value ranker (L; revisit once 023 + 035 + 037 land),
0003 C18 carrack, 0003 C19 war hours (unverified), 0004 F18 treasure
tracker, 0004 F19 Marni's Stone, 0004 F20 barter log, 0004 F21 registration
queue (arsha /queue Imperva-blocked), 0004 F25 worker empire (L). Merged:
0003 C07 + C11 into 034, 0004 F05 + F06 + F07 into 036, 0004 F08 + F12 into
039, 0004 F09 + F10 into 038, 0003 C13 + C14 and 0004 F24 into 055, 0005
F7/F8 into 050. Blocked lanes: a dependent plan dispatched early writes a
`blocked` marker; plan 019 adds the `blocked` item state that re-dispatches
it once its Depends-on rows are `[x]`.

Deep dive 2026-10-05 (research 0002): one plan, 018 - the Global Lab level
cap 75 / XP rescale can go live at the 2026-10-08 maintenance and would make
EW reject level 71+ and mislead the level ETA. A proposed 019 (patch-notes
watcher) was dropped in refute round 2/3 as a duplicate of the Deadeye tab
(007); see research 0002 section 7.

Ranking 011-014 (adjudicated 2026-10-05, value to a new Season Deadeye who is
leveling now): 011 helps every leveling hour with zero external risk; 012
decides where those hours go; 013 tracks the pass the leveling feeds; 014
saves minutes a week and depends on the publisher's crawl policy.
Alternatives ranked lower: OCR of the XP bar (needs 011 first), market
extensions (low value while leveling).

Rules: refute rounds capped at 3 per item; every plan lands via a lane worktree
and one push; ETA log updated by every run.

## Order N715c44 - blocked items

Done in-lane: item-14 inbox rules folded into the loop tick (`tools/ew_inbox.py`,
`tools/ew_loop.py`; triage sonnet/low/bare, ack = ledger line, 6 notes a day,
HOP lines, batch notes, kind build/inbox/triage); plan 015 deviation 13. No
responder task existed, none disabled.

- DONE (kit-v8 branch, main session): kit v8 vendored into `ops/fleet_kit/` (12/12 hashes vs MAIN outbox, one commit), FLEET-COMMON block re-embedded, conformance test pinned to v8; the tick now calls the kit's `fleet_inbox` directly and `tools/ew_inbox.py` is removed (plan 015 deviation 14).

## Order Nfa7953 - blocked items

- Section 4 Scorecard before/after: BLOCKED - needs the scorecard v5.5.0 Linux binary downloaded into WSL (operator-approved download).
